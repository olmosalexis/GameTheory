# GameTheory

Our team is excited to present our game theory project, an interactive and educational game designed to help users understand the concept of game theory. 
The project includes a shiny application that allows users to play a game and see the outcomes based on different strategies. 
We have also included information on the design, research, and acknowledgement processes that went into the development of this project. 
Through this project, we hope to provide a fun and engaging way for users to learn about game theory and its applications.
